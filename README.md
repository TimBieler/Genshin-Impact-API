# Genshin-Impact-API

## by Tim, Samanta, Luke  

Hello, this is our README file for our project, it's about Genshin Impact.

This API is a helpful gadget when you play the game. It's a lot easier instead

of looking on the internet. It helps you find good artifacts and the best weapon for the characters. 

It shows you in which dungeon which artifact is located.

It also shows you some interesting facts about each character.

For example weapon type or which nation they're coming from.
